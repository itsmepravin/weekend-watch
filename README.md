# Welcome to Weekend Watch

[Live Website Running Here](https://weekend-watch-task.netlify.app)
This is a assessment task/project I built for the the application for "Junior Fronted Developer" for Nepalese company [Ramailo Technology](https://np.linkedin.com/company/ramailo-technology?trk=public_jobs_topcard-org-name). As requested, this project only uses React, React-Router and SASS. [react-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons) has been used for icons.
